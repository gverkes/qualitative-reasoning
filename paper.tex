\section{Base Problem}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inflow (of water into the container) $\in [0, +]$
\item Outflow (of water out of the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\item Volume (of the water in the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dependencies:}

\begin{itemize}
\item I+(Inflow, Volume): the amount of inflow increases the volume
\item I-(Outflow, Volume): the amount of outflow decreases the volume
\item P+(Volume, Outflow): outflow changes are proportional to volume changes
\item V(Volume(Max), Outflow(Max)): the outflow is at its highest value (Max), when the volume is at it highest value
\item V(Volume(0), Outflow(0)): there is no outflow, when there is no volume
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm}

\end{algorithm}

\section{State-graph}
The algorithm from the previous section generates a list of states which are unique values of Inflow, Tank and Ouflow and their first derivatives. Each state has a number of reachable states after an amount of time or a change in the state from an external influence. For this problem the only external influence we allow is changing the derivative of the Inflow (which is opening and closing the tap).

In figure \ref{state-graph} shows all possible behaviors of the system described above. Blue nodes are final states, which are states without other reachable states. Other nodes are red and each arrow represents a transition.

\section{Extra Problem}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inflow (of water into the container) $\in [0, +]$
\item Outflow (of water out of the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\item Volume (of the water in the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\item Height (of the water column in the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\item Pressure (of the water column at the bottom of the container) $\in [0, +, Max]$
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dependencies:}

\begin{itemize}
\item I+(Inflow, Volume): the amount of inflow increases the volume
\item I-(Outflow, Volume): the amount of outflow decreases the volume
\item P+(Volume, Height): height changes are proportional to volume changes
\item P+(Height, Pressure): pressure changes are proportional to height changes
\item P+(Pressure, Outflow): outflow changes are proportional to pressure changes
\item V(Volume(Max), Height(Max)): the height is at its highest value (Max), when the volume is at it highest value
\item V(Volume(0), Height(0)): there is no height, when there is no volume
\item V(Height(Max), Pressure(Max)): the pressure is at its highest value (Max), when the height is at it highest value
\item V(Height(0), Pressure(0)): there is no pressure, when there is no height
\item V(Pressure(Max), Outflow(Max)): the outflow is at its highest value (Max), when the pressure is at it highest value
\item V(Pressure(0), Outflow(0)): there is no outflow, when there is no pressure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
